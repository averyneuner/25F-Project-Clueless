# `pages` Folder

This folder contains all the pages that will be part of the application. Details on required numbers will be provided in the Phase 3 documentation.

These pages are meant to show you an example of some of the features of Streamlit and the way we will limit functionality access by role/persona. It is not meant to represent a complete application.

TODO: Describe the pages folder and include link to documentation. Don't forget about ordering of pages.


Business Owner Persona —— _36, 37, 38, 39, 40. 
These files were added as a means of building out the front end of the Business User's page, Rebecca. She has the ability to add items or remove items from her inventory (38), add or remove items from her wishlist (39), send the analyst notifications (40), and on her homepage she is able to see a quick snapshot of her current inventory (_36)!
